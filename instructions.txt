- When you are in a module, you can choose what you want to do from the values:
        MOVE or M - lets you move to a different module in the space station
        SCANNER or S - allows you to search for aliens and lock modules
        INSTRUCTIONS or I - allows you to load game instructions
        STORY or S - allows you to read the backstory of the game

- The locations of the Main Alien NPC, Information Panels, Ventilation shafts and Feul cells are shown at the top of the program, underneath the game title and version info.
- +50 to +100 extra power (random amount) is added to your weapon when you enter a ventilation shaft
- +10 to +50 extra power (random amount) is added to your weapon when you enter a module with a fuel canister/fuel cell
- The Main Alien NPC moves randomly around the spaceship, and to trap it, lock all exits that the NPC can escape out of

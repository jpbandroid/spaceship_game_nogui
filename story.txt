TELIUM STORY:

A remote probe on the surface of Mars has detected biological signatures of dormant, single-celled life. A sample of the soil is returned to a space station orbiting Earth for analysis.

The orange-coloured cells are examined and DNA analysis of the cells shows similarities to a species of soil amoeba from Earth. It is commonly referred to as slime mould. It can transition from a collection of single-celled organisms to a multicellular organism, then into a fruiting body.

The sample is nicknamed Telium due to its colour and cellular structure. It is incubated in a lab with conditions similar to Mars' ancient past.

Independent cells of Telium begin to move, and soon join together to form a slug-like organism. Later, the creature begins to grow arms and starts to look like a large starfish. The scientists continue to examine Telium, as it consumes bacteria and gets larger as time passes.
Eventually, it begins to show signs of advanced movement, and its strength increases significantly. Eventually, it breaks out of its chamber and travels to an unknown location in the space station.

Telium is not seen for several days, and tension escalates between the astronauts when electronics starts to behave erratically, power starts draining, and communication with Earth is lost.
The capitan orders that Telium must be found and destroyed and that the astronauts need to stay together to solve this.
